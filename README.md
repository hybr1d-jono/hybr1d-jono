About Me 👋   
Hi, I’m Jono - I have been in the Quality Assurance field for over 10 years and predominantly as a Manual Tester but learning Test Automation as a side hobby. 

Why Am I here 🏢  
I’m interested in sharing my journey as I evolve into Test Automation and AI to better equip myself while showcasing some of my work along the way.  
I’m currently using UDEMY to learn basic coding concepts aswell as learning 1 on 1 inperson with work colleagues who have more knowledge on Test Automation  
I’m looking to collaborate on all areas of Quality Assurance.
